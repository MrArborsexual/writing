Situation:   What if so much suffering existed in the Fennic world that it attacted an extra-planar entity to feed on it, and even farm it?
Sentence:    The Fennic world, Bria, has had it recent hard won peace shattered just as it had the chance to heal and progress past historic wrongs, and this turmoil has attracted the personification of suffering, Esveld and her plane of Forria to feed on it.
Paragraph:   Only recently have The Four Fens won hard fought for peace, by unleashing terrible magic against the Bylish Empire at a part of the world now know only as "The Last Battle". The old wounds in the Fennic nation are still festering though. Bylish is simply biding their time, waiting to retake the Fens when they are weak, and the Fennic literal worship of progress has left many of their own people, particularly the conquered, behind. The Fens are descending into civil war, and the Bylish, as well as other nations, smell blood in the water. The dread, pain, suffering, and fear of the inevitable have emanated from Bria for so long that it has attracted the attention of Esveld, the current occupant to the throne of suffering, and a new player in the many pantheons of Bria.
