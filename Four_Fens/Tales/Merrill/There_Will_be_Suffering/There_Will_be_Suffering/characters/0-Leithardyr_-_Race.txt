Name:                Leithardyr - Race
ID:                  0
Importance:          0
POV:                 True
Motivation:          Seek to prove their individuality.
Goal:                Prevent the slow extinction of their race.
Conflict:            Insanity and personality abominations are becoming increasingly common in their offspring. This forces increasing numbers of cullings, and fewer Leithardyr allowing their offspring to live.
Epiphany:            Their race can be saved by fresh bloodlines from males, however male Leithardyr are terrifying monstrosities. That isn't an overstatement.
Phrase Summary:      An ancient race of parthenogenic females, that is slowly going extinct.
Paragraph Summary:   An ancient race of parthenogenic females, that is slowly going extinct. They were intentionally created as a servile companion race on another plane. While this granted them intelligence, functionally immortal lifespans, hereditary memory, and the ability to reproduce parthenogenically, it came at the cost of having any innate magical ability, and the effects of the various changes to their biology on males was completely ignored. The Leithardyr on Bria represent a branch of this species that successfully escaped their creators, multiplied, and have now stagnated.

                     Leithardyr have only a single city, Poikil, in the far north of Bria, that is isolated from the rest of the world. There only Leithardyr live, along with a grove of Treekin that aid in communication between this city, Leithardyr embassies, and nations. The Leithardyr go out of their way to maintain positive relations with other races and the various nations of Bria, allowing their race to move freely in even the most hostile parts of Bria. As Leithardyr generally prefer exploration and expression of individuality, over static administrative lives, the ability to leave Poikil is dolled out on lottery, with time spent staffing the administrative functions of Poikil and remote embassies increasing the odds that one can leave and live an independent life.
                     
                     Memories are inherited by daughters from their mothers, including every female in their line, up to their line originator that first stepped into Bria. There is a limit in that the memories only include those in her mother, and repeated up her line, up to the moment of conception. As Leithardyr are functionally immortal, the memory difference between individuals can be surprisingly large.
                     
                     The inherited memories are not immediately accessible to the offspring, and the offspring only start being able to access these memories in their adolescent years. Young Leithardyr require intensive tutelage to prepare their minds for the immense psychological toll their inherited memories can bring, as accessing these memories can cause a complete loss of individuality. The individual identity is possibly the most important thing to the entire Leithardyr race, and if a young Leithardyr loses herself to inherited personality she will be killed. Similarly if a Leithardyr mother believes she cannot get
Notes:               Keep sexualization down. I know I'm a horny bastard, but 9/10 readers ain't gonna want to read about the details of Leithardyr heat cycles, and reproduction.
